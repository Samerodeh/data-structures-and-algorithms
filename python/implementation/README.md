# Singly Linked List

***A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node.***

***Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.***


## Challenge 

* ***Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.*** 

* ***Create a Linked List class, Within your Linked List class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.***



## Approach & Efficiency

***Learn what a linkedlist is, how to work with it, and how to write code.***

## API

* insert

1. Arguments: value
2. Returns: nothing
3. Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

* includes

1. Arguments: value 
1. Returns: Boolean 
1. Indicates whether that value exists as a Node's value somewhere within the list.

* to string

1. Arguments: none
1. Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: 

*"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"*
