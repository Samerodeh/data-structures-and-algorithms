# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks

> Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

* Write a function called left join

* Arguments: two hash maps

1. The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.

1. The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

* Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesn’t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
